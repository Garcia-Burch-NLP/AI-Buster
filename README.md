# AI BUSTER

## Objective:

With the advance of AI chatbots like [OpenAi's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) concerns about a student's academic progression. Our goal is to create an ML model that is capable of identifying essays that are AI-generated.

## Since this problem is asking to identify `AI` or `Not AI` we will be utilizing a classifier for modeling. Some initial hypotheses we have are outlined below:
